                    The <b>Monastery of Saint Ivan of Rila</b>, better known as the <b>Rila Monastery</b> (<a
                        href="#">Bulgarian</a>: <span lang="bg">Рилски манастир</span>, <i>Rilski manastir</i>) is
                    the largest and most famous <i>Eastern Orthodox</i> monastery in Bulgaria. It is situated in the
                    southwestern <b>Rila Mountains</b>, 117 km (73 mi) south of
                    the capital <b>Sofia</b> in the deep valley of the <i>Rilska River</i> ("Rila River") at an
                    elevation of 1,147 m (3,763 ft) above sea level, inside of
                    <b>Rila Monastery Nature Park</b>. The monastery is named after its founder, the hermit <b>Ivan of
                        Rila</b> (876 - 946 AD), and houses around 60 monks.
                    <br>
                    Founded in the 10th century, the Rila Monastery is regarded as one of Bulgaria's most important
                    cultural, historical and architectural monuments and is a key tourist attraction for
                    both Bulgaria and Southern Europe. In 2008 alone, it attracted 900,000 visitors.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    It is traditionally thought that the monastery was founded by the hermit St. Ivan of Rila, whose
                    name it bears, during the rule of Tsar Peter I (927-968). The hermit actually lived in
                    a cave without any material possessions not far from the monastery's location, while the complex was
                    built by his students, who came to the mountains to receive their education.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Ever since its creation, the Rila Monastery has been supported and respected by the Bulgarian
                    rulers. Large donations were made by almost every tsar of the Second Bulgarian Empire up
                    until the Ottoman Conquest, making the monastery a cultural and spiritual centre of Bulgarian
                    national consciousness that reached its apogee from the 12th to the 14th century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Rila Monastery was reerected at its present place by Hrelyu, a feudal lord, during the first
                    half of the 14th century. The oldest buildings in the complex date from this period - the
                    Tower of Hrelja (1334–1335) and a small church just next to it (1343). The bishop's throne and the
                    rich-engraved gates of the monastery also belong to the time. However, the arrival of
                    the Ottomans in the end of the 14th century was followed by numerous raids and a destruction of the
                    monastery in the middle of the 15th century.
