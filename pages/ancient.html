                    <b>Plovdiv Roman theatre</b> (<u>Latin:</u> <i lang="la"><small>TEATRUM
                            TRIMONTENSE</small></i>; <u>Bulgarian:</u>
                    <span lang="bg">Пловдивски античен театър</span>, <i>Plovdivski antichen teatar</i>) is one of the
                    world's best-preserved ancient
                    Roman theatre, located in the city center of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. It was
                    constructed in the 90s of the 1st century AD, probably during the reign of Emperor Domitian. The
                    theatre can host between 5000
                    and 7000 spectators and it is currently in use.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The spectator seats are orientated to the south, towards the ancient city in the lowland and the
                    Rhodope Mountains. In outline, the theatre is a
                    semi-circle with an outer diameter of 82 meters. The theatre itself is divided into the seating
                    section (cavea) and the stage (orchestra). The cavea,
                    the area in which people gathered, is hollowed out of a hill or slope, while the outer radian seats
                    required structural support and solid retaining walls.
                    The cavea was not roofed. The spectator seats surround the stage (orchestra), which has the shape of
                    a horseshoe, 26.64 meters long, includes 28 concentric
                    rows of marble seats, divided into two tiers by an aisle (diazoma). The upper part of the tiers is
                    interrupted by narrow radial stairways, which divide the
                    cavea into wedge-shaped sectors (kerkides). The theatre also has a podium, which supports the
                    columns of the scaenae frons.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The stage building – the scaenae frons – is south of the orchestra. It has three floors and is a
                    high wall of the stage floor, supported by columns. The
                    proscenium is a wall that supports the front edge of the stage with ornately decorated niches off to
                    the sides. The proscaenium, which is 3.16 meters high,
                    and its facade is decorated with an Ionic marble colonnade with triangular pediments. The facade of
                    the scenae, which overlooks the spectators' area,
                    consists of two two-storey porticos, the first in the Roman Ionic order and the second in the
                    Roman-Corinthian order. The facade is cut through by three
                    symmetrically located gates. The entrances to the orchestra, which are uncovered and vaulted,
                    connect the cavea with the stage building. An underground
                    vaulted passage begins from the centre of the orchestra, goes under the stage building and leads out
                    of the theatre. Another vaulted passage, passing under
                    the central bank of seats of the top tier, connects the cavea with the Three Hills area.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Similar to all the theatres on the territory of the Roman Empire, in the theatre of Trimontium the
                    honorary spectator seats were inscribed. There were inscriptions
                    not only for the representatives of the city council but also for magistrates, friends of the
                    Emperor, etc. Some honorary inscriptions show that the building was
                    used as the seat of the Thracian provincial assembly. Built with around 7,000 seats, each section of
                    seating had the names of the city quarters engraved on the
                    benches so the citizens knew where they were to sit.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Whereas Greeks preferred the exercises of gymnasium and stadium, Roman interest in sport went to the
                    events at the theatre and circus. Thus,
                    presumably, gladiatorial fights with animals were held in the theatre, as remains of safety
                    facilities in front of the first row have been uncovered. These additions
                    were set because of the visit of Emperor Caracalla to Trimontium in 214 AD. The theater was damaged
                    in the 5th century AD by Attila the Hun.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The theater was only found in the early 1970s due to a landslide. This caused a major archeological
                    excavation, including the removal of some 4.5 m of earth covering
                    what was left hidden by the landslide. The restoration of the Roman theatre in Plovdiv is considered
                    one of the best achievements of the Bulgarian Conservation School.
                    The intervention is limited on the basis of rigorous tests and exclusion of assumptions. The
                    reconstruction was made strictly according to the method of anastylosis and
                    the new material is clearly visible. The theatre is one of the numerous constructions from the time
                    of the Roman Empire, preserved in Bulgaria. There are several steles
                    and wall inscriptions in Byzantine Greek language in the theatre.
