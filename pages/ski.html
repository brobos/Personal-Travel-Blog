                <p>
                    <b>Pamporovo</b> (<a href="#">Bulgarian</a>: <span lang="bg">Пампорово</span>, <i>pronunciation</i>:
                    /pam'porovo/) is a popular ski resort in Smolyan Province,
                    southern Bulgaria. It is set amongst Norway spruce forests and is primarily visited during the
                    winter for
                    skiing and snowboarding. It is also a popular tourist place in summer. The hub of Pamporovo
                    comprises a number of hotels and bars.
                    It is a family-friendly resort and suited for complete beginners and intermediates.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Skiing</h3>
                <p>
                    The resort has 55 km of ski-runs and 38 km of cross-country skiing tracks served by 18 lifts with a
                    total capacity of 13,000 persons per hour. Seven snow-levelling machines and
                    90% covered with snow cannons guarantee skiers comfortable and enjoyable downhill rides. More than
                    100 highly qualified ski instructors, fluent in various languages, are available
                    to aid both beginners and intermediate skiers as well as snowboarders. Some new runs have been
                    created and there is now another chairlift in operation Servicing the new Stoykite
                    ski runs and a T-bar replaced with a fixed grip 4 Man chairlift.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The winters in Pamporovo tend to be mild, but have around 150 days of snowfall each year. This
                    combination allows for a long skiing season at the resort.
                    Pamporovo is renowned for its large number of sunny days during the winter, often topping 120 days
                    from December to May. The average January
                    temperature is −3 degrees Celsius (or 26.6 F).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much of the older development of the Pamporovo resort lies to the northeast of Snezhanka. Now, to
                    the south there is an up-market residential
                    development called the Pine Lodge, adjacent to the Smolyan Lakes ski lift. There are plans afoot to
                    build two golf courses and to extend the
                    whole skiing area to the Perelik mountain. The Pine Lodge faces the south towards the land of
                    Spartacus, within neighbouring Greece; and a
                    new EU-funded highway will make the Greek coast accessible by car. <br>
                    <br>
                    In January 2010 an additional border crossing point was opened between Bulgaria and Greece which is
                    just half an hour drive from Pamporovo by car. This brought considerable attention by tourists and
                    media to the resort as being the only one in Europe to allow for such a short time to switch from
                    skiing to swimming.
